 ENGR 102 Project

Do note that this should all be kept in the same folder. The pages will not be able to redirect correctly otherwise.

Also, in order for ENGR 102 Project.html to properly access the Google Spreadsheet API, you must run a local server. Do so by navigating to the project folder in the terminal and typing the command "python -m http.server" or "python3 -m http.server" depending on your version of Python.

If you would like to modify this code and use your own Google Spreadsheet, do be aware that the spreadsheetURL constant in ENGR 102 Project.html must be modified. The Spreadsheet ID can be found in the Spreadsheet URL between the d/ and /edit. This can replace the ID found in the spreadsheetURL between app/ and /1. Also note that /1 in the spreadsheetURL means that we are converting the first page of the Spreadsheet, in my case titled "1." If your page is titled different, make the appropriate change to the URL.

Other pages besides ENGR 102 Project.html and createyourown.html are not currently implemented but may be in the future.
